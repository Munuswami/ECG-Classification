# ECG Classifier Repository

This repository contains the implementation of an ECG (Electrocardiogram) classification system using Python. The code processes ECG signal data, applies machine learning algorithms, and evaluates the performance of different classifiers.

## Contents

- **`ECG_Classifier.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for ECG classification.
- **`ecg.csv`**: The dataset used for the project (if included).
- **README.md**: Overview and instructions for this repository.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling and cleaning ECG signal data.
- **Visualization**: Signal exploration using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Linear Regression (baseline comparison)
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Neighbours
- **Performance Metrics**: Metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification reports.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Process
- **Step 1:** Load the Dataset :The ECG dataset (ecg.csv) is read into a pandas DataFrame.Missing values, if any, are handled during the preprocessing step.
- **Step 2:** Data Preprocessing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.Normalize or scale features for better model performance.
- **Step 3:** Visualization:
 -Explore the data with visualizations:
   -Line plots to display raw ECG signals.Histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution of features.Heatmaps for visualizing feature correlations.
- **Step 4:** Train Machine Learning Models:
 -Train and test various models:
   -Logistic Regression: Simple and effective baseline classifier.Support Vector Machines (SVM): For more complex decision boundaries.Linear Regression: Used as a comparative baseline.
- **Step 5:** Evaluate PerformanceUse metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion matrix
  - Precision, recall, and F1-score (classification report).
 - **Step 6:** Visualize Results:
   - Visualize model performance:
   - Confusion matrix heatmaps.
   - ROC curves to evaluate classification thresholds.
   - Bar plots comparing model accuracies.
## Conclusion
 -The ECG classification system demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in medical data analysis.Logistic Regression and SVM are particularly effective for this dataset.Future improvements could involve deep learning models for more complex datasets or real-time signal processing.
